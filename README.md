SublimeLinter-pyyaml DEPRECATED
===============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-pyyaml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-pyyaml)

This package has been deprecated. [SublimeLinter-contrib-yamllint](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-yamllint) provides a smarter and more modern approach to linting yaml, please upgrade to that. SublimeLinter 4 will drop support for SL-pyyaml.
